%0dMy name is [NAME], and I am a [GRADUATION YEAR] KS [ALUMNI/STUDENT/PARENT]. I am writing to demand Kamehameha Schools cease its current state of inaction and SUPPORT the Black Lives Matter movement. I find it appalling that my alma mater has yet to denounce the horrific actions of law enforcement throughout the United States. During the Kū Kiaʻi Mauna movement, the Black Community stood in solidarity with us. Hawaiians have faced injustices similar to those the Black Community has faced for years, yet Kamehameha Schools has been hesitant to use its far-reaching platform to enact meaningful change, empower the Black Community (which includes Black KS students), donate to organizations related to BLM, and make a statement regarding the need for dismantling white supremacy and racism from internalized and structural levels. KS' silence is particularly deafening during these times because being bystanding on an institutional level inhibits the voices of those who do not have the power to speak out. I strongly urge you to consider using your power to ACT NOW.
